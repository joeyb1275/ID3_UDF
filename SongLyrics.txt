And do you ever feel like you're alone?
And do you ever wish to be unknown?
I can say that I have...
I can say that I have...
And do you ever feel things here aren't right?
And do you ever feel the time slip by?
I can say that I have...
And I can say that I have...

So hear this please
And watch as your heart speeds up endlessly
And look for the stars as the sun goes down
Each breath that you take has a thunderous sound
Everything, everything's magic
Just sit back and hold on, but hold on tight
Prepare for the best and the fastest ride
And reach out your hand, and I'll make you mine
Everything, everything's magic
[ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/a/angels_and_airwaves/everythings_magic.html ]
And do you ever lay awake at night?
And do you ever tell yourself, don't try
Don't try to let yourself down,
Don't try to let yourself down...
And do you ever see yourself in love?
And do you ever take a chance, my love?
Because you know that I will...
Because you know that I will...

So hear this please
And watch as your hearts speeds up endlessly
And look for the stars as the sun goes down
Each breath that you take has a thunderous sound
Everything, everything's magic
Just sit back and hold on, but hold on tight
Prepare for the best and the fastest ride
And reach out your hand, and I'll make you mine
Everything, everything's magic
Everything, everything's magic

So hear this please
And watch as your hearts speeds up endlessly
And look for the stars as the sun goes down
Each breath that you take has a thunderous sound
Everything, everything's magic
Just sit back and hold on, but hold on tight
Prepare for the best and the fastest ride
And reach out your hand, and I'll make you mine
Everything, everything's magic
