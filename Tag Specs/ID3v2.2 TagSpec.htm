<span class="anchor" id="line-21"></span>Abstract
<span class="anchor" id="line-22"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-23"></span>   The recent gain of popularity for MPEG layer III audio files on the
<span class="anchor" id="line-24"></span>   internet forced a standardised way of storing information about an
<span class="anchor" id="line-25"></span>   audio file within itself to determinate its origin and contents.
<span class="anchor" id="line-26"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-27"></span>   Today the most accepted way to do this is with the so called ID3 tag,
<span class="anchor" id="line-28"></span>   which is simple but very limited and in some cases very unsuitable.
<span class="anchor" id="line-29"></span>   The ID3 tag has very limited space in every field, very limited
<span class="anchor" id="line-30"></span>   numbers of fields, not expandable or upgradeable and is placed at the
<span class="anchor" id="line-31"></span>   end of a the file, which is unsuitable for streaming audio. This draft
<span class="anchor" id="line-32"></span>   is an attempt to answer these issues with a new version of the ID3
<span class="anchor" id="line-33"></span>   tag.

<span class="anchor" id="line-82"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-83"></span>   In the examples, text within "" is a text string exactly as it appears
<span class="anchor" id="line-84"></span>   in a file. Numbers preceded with $ are hexadecimal and numbers
<span class="anchor" id="line-85"></span>   preceded with % are binary. $xx is used to indicate a byte with
<span class="anchor" id="line-86"></span>   unknown content. %x is used to indicate a bit with unknown content.
<span class="anchor" id="line-87"></span>   The most significant bit (MSB) of a byte is called 'bit 7' and the
<span class="anchor" id="line-88"></span>   least significant bit (LSB) is called 'bit 0'.
<span class="anchor" id="line-89"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-90"></span>   A tag is the whole tag described in this document. A frame is a block
<span class="anchor" id="line-91"></span>   of information in the tag. The tag consists of a header, frames and
<span class="anchor" id="line-92"></span>   optional padding. A field is a piece of information; one value, a
<span class="anchor" id="line-93"></span>   string etc. A numeric string is a string that consists of the
<span class="anchor" id="line-94"></span>   characters 0-9 only.
<span class="anchor" id="line-95"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-96"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-97"></span>3.   ID3v2 overview
<span class="anchor" id="line-98"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-99"></span>   The two biggest design goals were to be able to implement ID3v2
<span class="anchor" id="line-100"></span>   without disturbing old software too much and that ID3v2 should be
<span class="anchor" id="line-101"></span>   expandable.
<span class="anchor" id="line-102"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-103"></span>   The first criterion is met by the simple fact that the MPEG [MPEG]
<span class="anchor" id="line-104"></span>   decoding software uses a syncsignal, embedded in the audiostream, to
<span class="anchor" id="line-105"></span>   'lock on to' the audio. Since the ID3v2 tag doesn't contain a valid
<span class="anchor" id="line-106"></span>   syncsignal, no software will attempt to play the tag. If, for any
<span class="anchor" id="line-107"></span>   reason, coincidence make a syncsignal appear within the tag it will be
<span class="anchor" id="line-108"></span>   taken care of by the 'unsynchronisation scheme' described in section
<span class="anchor" id="line-109"></span>   5.
<span class="anchor" id="line-110"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-111"></span>   The second criterion has made a more noticeable impact on the design
<span class="anchor" id="line-112"></span>   of the ID3v2 tag. It is constructed as a container for several
<span class="anchor" id="line-113"></span>   information blocks, called frames, whose format need not be known to
<span class="anchor" id="line-114"></span>   the software that encounters them. At the start of every frame there
<span class="anchor" id="line-115"></span>   is an identifier that explains the frames's format and content, and a
<span class="anchor" id="line-116"></span>   size descriptor that allows software to skip unknown frames.
<span class="anchor" id="line-117"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-118"></span>   If a total revision of the ID3v2 tag should be needed, there is a
<span class="anchor" id="line-119"></span>   version number and a size descriptor in the ID3v2 header.
<span class="anchor" id="line-120"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-121"></span>   The ID3 tag described in this document is mainly targeted to files
<span class="anchor" id="line-122"></span>   encoded with MPEG-2 layer I, MPEG-2 layer II, MPEG-2 layer III and
<span class="anchor" id="line-123"></span>   MPEG-2.5, but may work with other types of encoded audio.
<span class="anchor" id="line-124"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-125"></span>   The bitorder in ID3v2 is most significant bit first (MSB). The
<span class="anchor" id="line-126"></span>   byteorder in multibyte numbers is most significant byte first (e.g.
<span class="anchor" id="line-127"></span>   $12345678 would be encoded $12 34 56 78).
<span class="anchor" id="line-128"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-129"></span>   It is permitted to include padding after all the final frame (at the
<span class="anchor" id="line-130"></span>   end of the ID3 tag), making the size of all the frames together
<span class="anchor" id="line-131"></span>   smaller than the size given in the head of the tag. A possible purpose
<span class="anchor" id="line-132"></span>   of this padding is to allow for adding a few additional frames or
<span class="anchor" id="line-133"></span>   enlarge existing frames within the tag without having to rewrite the
<span class="anchor" id="line-134"></span>   entire file. The value of the padding bytes must be $00.
<span class="anchor" id="line-135"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-136"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-137"></span>3.1.   ID3v2 header
<span class="anchor" id="line-138"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-139"></span>   The ID3v2 tag header, which should be the first information in the
<span class="anchor" id="line-140"></span>   file, is 10 bytes as follows:
<span class="anchor" id="line-141"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-142"></span>     ID3/file identifier      "ID3"
<span class="anchor" id="line-143"></span>     ID3 version              $02 00
<span class="anchor" id="line-144"></span>     ID3 flags                %xx000000
<span class="anchor" id="line-145"></span>     ID3 size             4 * %0xxxxxxx
<span class="anchor" id="line-146"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-147"></span>   The first three bytes of the tag are always "ID3" to indicate that
<span class="anchor" id="line-148"></span>   this is an ID3 tag, directly followed by the two version bytes. The
<span class="anchor" id="line-149"></span>   first byte of ID3 version is it's major version, while the second byte
<span class="anchor" id="line-150"></span>   is its revision number. All revisions are backwards compatible while
<span class="anchor" id="line-151"></span>   major versions are not. If software with ID3v2 and below support
<span class="anchor" id="line-152"></span>   should encounter version three or higher it should simply ignore the
<span class="anchor" id="line-153"></span>   whole tag. Version and revision will never be $FF.
<span class="anchor" id="line-154"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-155"></span>   The first bit (bit 7) in the 'ID3 flags' is indicating whether or not
<span class="anchor" id="line-156"></span>   unsynchronisation is used (see section 5 for details); a set bit
<span class="anchor" id="line-157"></span>   indicates usage.
<span class="anchor" id="line-158"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-159"></span>   The second bit (bit 6) is indicating whether or not compression is
<span class="anchor" id="line-160"></span>   used; a set bit indicates usage. Since no compression scheme has been
<span class="anchor" id="line-161"></span>   decided yet, the ID3 decoder (for now) should just ignore the entire
<span class="anchor" id="line-162"></span>   tag if the compression bit is set.
<span class="anchor" id="line-163"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-164"></span>   The ID3 tag size is encoded with four bytes where the first bit (bit
<span class="anchor" id="line-165"></span>   7) is set to zero in every byte, making a total of 28 bits. The zeroed
<span class="anchor" id="line-166"></span>   bits are ignored, so a 257 bytes long tag is represented as $00 00 02
<span class="anchor" id="line-167"></span>   01.
<span class="anchor" id="line-168"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-169"></span>   The ID3 tag size is the size of the complete tag after
<span class="anchor" id="line-170"></span>   unsychronisation, including padding, excluding the header (total tag
<span class="anchor" id="line-171"></span>   size - 10). The reason to use 28 bits (representing up to 256MB) for
<span class="anchor" id="line-172"></span>   size description is that we don't want to run out of space here.
<span class="anchor" id="line-173"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-174"></span>   A ID3v2 tag can be detected with the following pattern:
<span class="anchor" id="line-175"></span>     $49 44 33 yy yy xx zz zz zz zz
<span class="anchor" id="line-176"></span>   Where yy is less than $FF, xx is the 'flags' byte and zz is less than
<span class="anchor" id="line-177"></span>   $80.
<span class="anchor" id="line-178"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-179"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-180"></span>3.2.   ID3v2 frames overview
<span class="anchor" id="line-181"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-182"></span>   The headers of the frames are similar in their construction. They
<span class="anchor" id="line-183"></span>   consist of one three character identifier (capital A-Z and 0-9) and
<span class="anchor" id="line-184"></span>   one three byte size field, making a total of six bytes. The header is
<span class="anchor" id="line-185"></span>   excluded from the size. Identifiers beginning with "X", "Y" and "Z"
<span class="anchor" id="line-186"></span>   are for experimental use and free for everyone to use. Have in mind
<span class="anchor" id="line-187"></span>   that someone else might have used the same identifier as you. All
<span class="anchor" id="line-188"></span>   other identifiers are either used or reserved for future use.
<span class="anchor" id="line-189"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-190"></span>   The three character frame identifier is followed by a three byte size
<span class="anchor" id="line-191"></span>   descriptor, making a total header size of six bytes in every frame.
<span class="anchor" id="line-192"></span>   The size is calculated as framesize excluding frame identifier and
<span class="anchor" id="line-193"></span>   size descriptor (frame size - 6).
<span class="anchor" id="line-194"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-195"></span>   There is no fixed order of the frames' appearance in the tag, although
<span class="anchor" id="line-196"></span>   it is desired that the frames are arranged in order of significance
<span class="anchor" id="line-197"></span>   concerning the recognition of the file. An example of such order:
<span class="anchor" id="line-198"></span>   UFI, MCI, TT2 ...
<span class="anchor" id="line-199"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-200"></span>   A tag must contain at least one frame. A frame must be at least 1 byte
<span class="anchor" id="line-201"></span>   big, excluding the 6-byte header.
<span class="anchor" id="line-202"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-203"></span>   If nothing else is said a string is represented as ISO-8859-1
<span class="anchor" id="line-204"></span>   [ISO-8859-1] characters in the range $20 - $FF. All unicode strings
<span class="anchor" id="line-205"></span>   [UNICODE] use 16-bit unicode 2.0 (ISO/IEC 10646-1:1993, UCS-2). All
<span class="anchor" id="line-206"></span>   numeric strings are always encoded as ISO-8859-1. Terminated strings
<span class="anchor" id="line-207"></span>   are terminated with $00 if encoded with ISO-8859-1 and $00 00 if
<span class="anchor" id="line-208"></span>   encoded as unicode. If nothing else is said newline character is
<span class="anchor" id="line-209"></span>   forbidden. In ISO-8859-1 a new line is represented, when allowed, with
<span class="anchor" id="line-210"></span>   $0A only. Frames that allow different types of text encoding have a
<span class="anchor" id="line-211"></span>   text encoding description byte directly after the frame size. If
<span class="anchor" id="line-212"></span>   ISO-8859-1 is used this byte should be $00, if unicode is used it
<span class="anchor" id="line-213"></span>   should be $01.
<span class="anchor" id="line-214"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-215"></span>   The three byte language field is used to describe the language of the
<span class="anchor" id="line-216"></span>   frame's content, according to ISO-639-2 [ISO-639-2].
<span class="anchor" id="line-217"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-218"></span>   All URLs [URL] may be relative, e.g. "picture.png", "../doc.txt".
<span class="anchor" id="line-219"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-220"></span>   If a frame is longer than it should be, e.g. having more fields than
<span class="anchor" id="line-221"></span>   specified in this document, that indicates that additions to the
<span class="anchor" id="line-222"></span>   frame have been made in a later version of the ID3 standard. This
<span class="anchor" id="line-223"></span>   is reflected by the revision number in the header of the tag.

<span class="anchor" id="line-308"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-309"></span>   This frame's purpose is to be able to identify the audio file in a
<span class="anchor" id="line-310"></span>   database that may contain more information relevant to the content.
<span class="anchor" id="line-311"></span>   Since standardisation of such a database is beyond this document, all
<span class="anchor" id="line-312"></span>   frames begin with a null-terminated string with a URL [URL] containing
<span class="anchor" id="line-313"></span>   an email address, or a link to a location where an email address can
<span class="anchor" id="line-314"></span>   be found, that belongs to the organisation responsible for this
<span class="anchor" id="line-315"></span>   specific database implementation. Questions regarding the database
<span class="anchor" id="line-316"></span>   should be sent to the indicated email address. The URL should not be
<span class="anchor" id="line-317"></span>   used for the actual database queries. If a $00 is found directly after
<span class="anchor" id="line-318"></span>   the 'Frame size' the whole frame should be ignored, and preferably be
<span class="anchor" id="line-319"></span>   removed. The 'Owner identifier' is then followed by the actual
<span class="anchor" id="line-320"></span>   identifier, which may be up to 64 bytes. There may be more than one
<span class="anchor" id="line-321"></span>   "UFI" frame in a tag, but only one with the same 'Owner identifier'.

<span class="anchor" id="line-329"></span>4.2.   Text information frames
<span class="anchor" id="line-330"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-331"></span>   The text information frames are the most important frames, containing
<span class="anchor" id="line-332"></span>   information like artist, album and more. There may only be one text
<span class="anchor" id="line-333"></span>   information frame of its kind in an tag. If the textstring is followed
<span class="anchor" id="line-334"></span>   by a termination ($00 (00)) all the following information should be
<span class="anchor" id="line-335"></span>   ignored and not be displayed. All the text information frames have the
<span class="anchor" id="line-336"></span>   following format:
<span class="anchor" id="line-337"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-338"></span>     Text information identifier  "T00" - "TZZ" , excluding "TXX",
<span class="anchor" id="line-339"></span>                                   described in 4.2.2.

<span class="anchor" id="line-347"></span>  TT1
<span class="anchor" id="line-348"></span>   The 'Content group description' frame is used if the sound belongs to
<span class="anchor" id="line-349"></span>   a larger category of sounds/music. For example, classical music is
<span class="anchor" id="line-350"></span>   often sorted in different musical sections (e.g. "Piano Concerto",
<span class="anchor" id="line-351"></span>   "Weather - Hurricane").
<span class="anchor" id="line-352"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-353"></span>  TT2
<span class="anchor" id="line-354"></span>   The 'Title/Songname/Content description' frame is the actual name of
<span class="anchor" id="line-355"></span>   the piece (e.g. "Adagio", "Hurricane Donna").
<span class="anchor" id="line-356"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-357"></span>  TT3
<span class="anchor" id="line-358"></span>   The 'Subtitle/Description refinement' frame is used for information
<span class="anchor" id="line-359"></span>   directly related to the contents title (e.g. "Op. 16" or "Performed
<span class="anchor" id="line-360"></span>   live at wembley").
<span class="anchor" id="line-361"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-362"></span>  TP1
<span class="anchor" id="line-363"></span>   The 'Lead artist(s)/Lead performer(s)/Soloist(s)/Performing group' is
<span class="anchor" id="line-364"></span>   used for the main artist(s). They are seperated with the "/"
<span class="anchor" id="line-365"></span>   character.
<span class="anchor" id="line-366"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-367"></span>  TP2
<span class="anchor" id="line-368"></span>   The 'Band/Orchestra/Accompaniment' frame is used for additional
<span class="anchor" id="line-369"></span>   information about the performers in the recording.
<span class="anchor" id="line-370"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-371"></span>  TP3
<span class="anchor" id="line-372"></span>   The 'Conductor' frame is used for the name of the conductor.
<span class="anchor" id="line-373"></span>   
<span class="anchor" id="line-374"></span>  TP4
<span class="anchor" id="line-375"></span>   The 'Interpreted, remixed, or otherwise modified by' frame contains
<span class="anchor" id="line-376"></span>   more information about the people behind a remix and similar
<span class="anchor" id="line-377"></span>   interpretations of another existing piece.
<span class="anchor" id="line-378"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-379"></span>  TCM
<span class="anchor" id="line-380"></span>   The 'Composer(s)' frame is intended for the name of the composer(s).
<span class="anchor" id="line-381"></span>   They are seperated with the "/" character.
<span class="anchor" id="line-382"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-383"></span>  TXT
<span class="anchor" id="line-384"></span>   The 'Lyricist(s)/text writer(s)' frame is intended for the writer(s)
<span class="anchor" id="line-385"></span>   of the text or lyrics in the recording. They are seperated with the
<span class="anchor" id="line-386"></span>   "/" character.
<span class="anchor" id="line-387"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-388"></span>  TLA
<span class="anchor" id="line-389"></span>   The 'Language(s)' frame should contain the languages of the text or
<span class="anchor" id="line-390"></span>   lyrics in the audio file. The language is represented with three
<span class="anchor" id="line-391"></span>   characters according to ISO-639-2. If more than one language is used
<span class="anchor" id="line-392"></span>   in the text their language codes should follow according to their
<span class="anchor" id="line-393"></span>   usage.
<span class="anchor" id="line-394"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-395"></span>  TCO
<span class="anchor" id="line-396"></span>   The content type, which previously (in ID3v1.1, see appendix A) was
<span class="anchor" id="line-397"></span>   stored as a one byte numeric value only, is now a numeric string. You
<span class="anchor" id="line-398"></span>   may use one or several of the types as ID3v1.1 did or, since the
<span class="anchor" id="line-399"></span>   category list would be impossible to maintain with accurate and up to
<span class="anchor" id="line-400"></span>   date categories, define your own.
<span class="anchor" id="line-401"></span>   References to the ID3v1 genres can be made by, as first byte, enter
<span class="anchor" id="line-402"></span>   "(" followed by a number from the genres list (section A.3.) and
<span class="anchor" id="line-403"></span>   ended with a ")" character. This is optionally followed by a
<span class="anchor" id="line-404"></span>   refinement, e.g. "(21)" or "(4)Eurodisco". Several references can be
<span class="anchor" id="line-405"></span>   made in the same frame, e.g. "(51)(39)". If the refinement should
<span class="anchor" id="line-406"></span>   begin with a "(" character it should be replaced with "((", e.g. "((I
<span class="anchor" id="line-407"></span>   can figure out any genre)" or "(55)((I think...)". The following new
<span class="anchor" id="line-408"></span>   content types is defined in ID3v2 and is implemented in the same way
<span class="anchor" id="line-409"></span>   as the numerig content types, e.g. "(RX)".

<span class="anchor" id="line-415"></span>   The 'Album/Movie/Show title' frame is intended for the title of the
<span class="anchor" id="line-416"></span>   recording(/source of sound) which the audio in the file is taken from.
<span class="anchor" id="line-417"></span>   
<span class="anchor" id="line-418"></span>  TPA
<span class="anchor" id="line-419"></span>   The 'Part of a set' frame is a numeric string that describes which
<span class="anchor" id="line-420"></span>   part of a set the audio came from. This frame is used if the source
<span class="anchor" id="line-421"></span>   described in the "TAL" frame is divided into several mediums, e.g. a
<span class="anchor" id="line-422"></span>   double CD. The value may be extended with a "/" character and a
<span class="anchor" id="line-423"></span>   numeric string containing the total number of parts in the set. E.g.
<span class="anchor" id="line-424"></span>   "1/2".
<span class="anchor" id="line-425"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-426"></span>  TRK
<span class="anchor" id="line-427"></span>   The 'Track number/Position in set' frame is a numeric string
<span class="anchor" id="line-428"></span>   containing the order number of the audio-file on its original
<span class="anchor" id="line-429"></span>   recording. This may be extended with a "/" character and a numeric
<span class="anchor" id="line-430"></span>   string containing the total numer of tracks/elements on the original
<span class="anchor" id="line-431"></span>   recording. E.g. "4/9".

<span class="anchor" id="line-549"></span>   The 'File type' frame indicates which type of audio this tag defines.
<span class="anchor" id="line-550"></span>   The following type and refinements are defined:
<span class="anchor" id="line-551"></span>   
<span class="anchor" id="line-552"></span>     MPG    MPEG Audio
<span class="anchor" id="line-553"></span>       /1     MPEG 2 layer I

<span class="anchor" id="line-556"></span>       /2.5   MPEG 2.5
<span class="anchor" id="line-557"></span>       /AAC   Advanced audio compression
<span class="anchor" id="line-558"></span>     
<span class="anchor" id="line-559"></span>   but other types may be used, not for these types though. This is used
<span class="anchor" id="line-560"></span>   in a similar way to the predefined types in the "TMT" frame, but
<span class="anchor" id="line-561"></span>   without parenthesis. If this frame is not present audio type is
<span class="anchor" id="line-562"></span>   assumed to be "MPG".
<span class="anchor" id="line-563"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-564"></span>  TBP
<span class="anchor" id="line-565"></span>   BPM is short for beats per minute, and is easily computed by
<span class="anchor" id="line-566"></span>   dividing the number of beats in a musical piece with its length. To
<span class="anchor" id="line-567"></span>   get a more accurate result, do the BPM calculation on the main-part
<span class="anchor" id="line-568"></span>   only. To acquire best result measure the time between each beat and
<span class="anchor" id="line-569"></span>   calculate individual BPM for each beat and use the median value as
<span class="anchor" id="line-570"></span>   result. BPM is an integer and represented as a numerical string.
<span class="anchor" id="line-571"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-572"></span>  TCR
<span class="anchor" id="line-573"></span>   The 'Copyright message' frame, which must begin with a year and a
<span class="anchor" id="line-574"></span>   space character (making five characters), is intended for the
<span class="anchor" id="line-575"></span>   copyright holder of the original sound, not the audio file itself. The
<span class="anchor" id="line-576"></span>   absence of this frame means only that the copyright information is
<span class="anchor" id="line-577"></span>   unavailable or has been removed, and must not be interpreted to mean
<span class="anchor" id="line-578"></span>   that the sound is public domain. Every time this field is displayed
<span class="anchor" id="line-579"></span>   the field must be preceded with "Copyright " (C) " ", where (C) is one
<span class="anchor" id="line-580"></span>   character showing a C in a circle.

<span class="anchor" id="line-610"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-611"></span>  TDY
<span class="anchor" id="line-612"></span>   The 'Playlist delay' defines the numbers of milliseconds of silence
<span class="anchor" id="line-613"></span>   between every song in a playlist. The player should use the "ETC"
<span class="anchor" id="line-614"></span>   frame, if present, to skip initial silence and silence at the end of
<span class="anchor" id="line-615"></span>   the audio to match the 'Playlist delay' time. The time is represented
<span class="anchor" id="line-616"></span>   as a numeric string.
<span class="anchor" id="line-617"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-618"></span>  TKE

<span class="anchor" id="line-728"></span>   Since there might be a lot of people contributing to an audio file in
<span class="anchor" id="line-729"></span>   various ways, such as musicians and technicians, the 'Text
<span class="anchor" id="line-730"></span>   information frames' are often insufficient to list everyone involved
<span class="anchor" id="line-731"></span>   in a project. The 'Involved people list' is a frame containing the
<span class="anchor" id="line-732"></span>   names of those involved, and how they were involved. The body simply
<span class="anchor" id="line-733"></span>   contains a terminated string with the involvement directly followed by
<span class="anchor" id="line-734"></span>   a terminated string with the involvee followed by a new involvement
<span class="anchor" id="line-735"></span>   and so on. There may only be one "IPL" frame in each tag.

<span class="anchor" id="line-744"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-745"></span>   This frame is intended for music that comes from a CD, so that the CD
<span class="anchor" id="line-746"></span>   can be identified in databases such as the CDDB [CDDB]. The frame
<span class="anchor" id="line-747"></span>   consists of a binary dump of the Table Of Contents, TOC,  from the CD,
<span class="anchor" id="line-748"></span>   which is a header of 4 bytes and then 8 bytes/track on the CD making a
<span class="anchor" id="line-749"></span>   maximum of 804 bytes. This frame requires a present and valid "TRK"
<span class="anchor" id="line-750"></span>   frame. There may only be one "MCI" frame in each tag.

<span class="anchor" id="line-758"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-759"></span>   This frame allows synchronisation with key events in a song or sound.
<span class="anchor" id="line-760"></span>   The head is:
<span class="anchor" id="line-761"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-762"></span>     Event timing codes   "ETC"

<span class="anchor" id="line-765"></span>     
<span class="anchor" id="line-766"></span>   Where time stamp format is:
<span class="anchor" id="line-767"></span>     
<span class="anchor" id="line-768"></span>     $01  Absolute time, 32 bit sized, using MPEG [MPEG] frames as unit
<span class="anchor" id="line-769"></span>     $02  Absolute time, 32 bit sized, using milliseconds as unit
<span class="anchor" id="line-770"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-771"></span>   Abolute time means that every stamp contains the time from the
<span class="anchor" id="line-772"></span>   beginning of the file.
<span class="anchor" id="line-773"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-774"></span>   Followed by a list of key events in the following format:
<span class="anchor" id="line-775"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-776"></span>     Type of event   $xx
<span class="anchor" id="line-777"></span>     Time stamp      $xx (xx ...)
<span class="anchor" id="line-778"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-779"></span>   The 'Time stamp' is set to zero if directly at the beginning of the
<span class="anchor" id="line-780"></span>   sound or after the previous event. All events should be sorted in
<span class="anchor" id="line-781"></span>   chronological order. The type of event is as follows:

<span class="anchor" id="line-807"></span>          the value $FF have the same function)
<span class="anchor" id="line-808"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-809"></span>   The 'Not predefined sync's ($E0-EF) are for user events. You might
<span class="anchor" id="line-810"></span>   want to synchronise your music to something, like setting of an
<span class="anchor" id="line-811"></span>   explosion on-stage, turning on your screensaver etc.
<span class="anchor" id="line-812"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-813"></span>   There may only be one "ETC" frame in each tag.

<span class="anchor" id="line-816"></span>4.7.   MPEG location lookup table
<span class="anchor" id="line-817"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-818"></span>   To increase performance and accuracy of jumps within a MPEG [MPEG]
<span class="anchor" id="line-819"></span>   audio file, frames with timecodes in different locations in the file
<span class="anchor" id="line-820"></span>   might be useful. The ID3 frame includes references that the software
<span class="anchor" id="line-821"></span>   can use to calculate positions in the file. After the frame header is
<span class="anchor" id="line-822"></span>   a descriptor of how much the 'frame counter' should increase for every
<span class="anchor" id="line-823"></span>   reference. If this value is two then the first reference points out
<span class="anchor" id="line-824"></span>   the second frame, the 2nd reference the 4th frame, the 3rd reference
<span class="anchor" id="line-825"></span>   the 6th frame etc. In a similar way the 'bytes between reference' and
<span class="anchor" id="line-826"></span>   'milliseconds between reference' points out bytes and milliseconds
<span class="anchor" id="line-827"></span>   respectively.
<span class="anchor" id="line-828"></span>   
<span class="anchor" id="line-829"></span>   Each reference consists of two parts; a certain number of bits, as
<span class="anchor" id="line-830"></span>   defined in 'bits for bytes deviation', that describes the difference
<span class="anchor" id="line-831"></span>   between what is said in 'bytes between reference' and the reality and
<span class="anchor" id="line-832"></span>   a certain number of bits, as defined in 'bits for milliseconds
<span class="anchor" id="line-833"></span>   deviation', that describes the difference between what is said in
<span class="anchor" id="line-834"></span>   'milliseconds between reference' and the reality. The number of bits
<span class="anchor" id="line-835"></span>   in every reference, i.e. 'bits for bytes deviation'+'bits for
<span class="anchor" id="line-836"></span>   milliseconds deviation', must be a multiple of four. There may only be
<span class="anchor" id="line-837"></span>   one "MLL" frame in each tag.
<span class="anchor" id="line-838"></span>

<span class="anchor" id="line-846"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-847"></span>   Then for every reference the following data is included;
<span class="anchor" id="line-848"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-849"></span>     Deviation in bytes         %xxx....
<span class="anchor" id="line-850"></span>     Deviation in milliseconds  %xxx....

<span class="anchor" id="line-853"></span>4.8.   Synced tempo codes
<span class="anchor" id="line-854"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-855"></span>   For a more accurate description of the tempo of a musical piece this
<span class="anchor" id="line-856"></span>   frame might be used. After the header follows one byte describing
<span class="anchor" id="line-857"></span>   which time stamp format should be used. Then follows one or more tempo
<span class="anchor" id="line-858"></span>   codes. Each tempo code consists of one tempo part and one time part.
<span class="anchor" id="line-859"></span>   The tempo is in BPM described with one or two bytes. If the first byte
<span class="anchor" id="line-860"></span>   has the value $FF, one more byte follows, which is added to the first
<span class="anchor" id="line-861"></span>   giving a range from 2 - 510 BPM, since $00 and $01 is reserved. $00 is
<span class="anchor" id="line-862"></span>   used to describe a beat-free time period, which is not the same as a
<span class="anchor" id="line-863"></span>   music-free time period. $01 is used to indicate one single beat-stroke
<span class="anchor" id="line-864"></span>   followed by a beat-free period.
<span class="anchor" id="line-865"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-866"></span>   The tempo descriptor is followed by a time stamp. Every time the tempo
<span class="anchor" id="line-867"></span>   in the music changes, a tempo descriptor may indicate this for the
<span class="anchor" id="line-868"></span>   player. All tempo descriptors should be sorted in chronological order.
<span class="anchor" id="line-869"></span>   The first beat-stroke in a time-period is at the same time as the beat
<span class="anchor" id="line-870"></span>   description occurs. There may only be one "STC" frame in each tag.

<span class="anchor" id="line-881"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-882"></span>   Abolute time means that every stamp contains the time from the

<span class="anchor" id="line-886"></span>4.9.   Unsychronised lyrics/text transcription
<span class="anchor" id="line-887"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-888"></span>   This frame contains the lyrics of the song or a text transcription of
<span class="anchor" id="line-889"></span>   other vocal activities. The head includes an encoding descriptor and
<span class="anchor" id="line-890"></span>   a content descriptor. The body consists of the actual text. The
<span class="anchor" id="line-891"></span>   'Content descriptor' is a terminated string. If no descriptor is
<span class="anchor" id="line-892"></span>   entered, 'Content descriptor' is $00 (00) only. Newline characters
<span class="anchor" id="line-893"></span>   are allowed in the text. Maximum length for the descriptor is 64
<span class="anchor" id="line-894"></span>   bytes. There may be more than one lyrics/text frame in each tag, but
<span class="anchor" id="line-895"></span>   only one with the same language and content descriptor.

<span class="anchor" id="line-907"></span>   This is another way of incorporating the words, said or sung lyrics,
<span class="anchor" id="line-908"></span>   in the audio file as text, this time, however, in sync with the audio.
<span class="anchor" id="line-909"></span>   It might also be used to describing events e.g. occurring on a stage
<span class="anchor" id="line-910"></span>   or on the screen in sync with the audio. The header includes a content
<span class="anchor" id="line-911"></span>   descriptor, represented with as terminated textstring. If no

<span class="anchor" id="line-933"></span>                   $05 is chord (e.g. "Bb F Fsus")
<span class="anchor" id="line-934"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-935"></span>   Time stamp format is:
<span class="anchor" id="line-936"></span>     
<span class="anchor" id="line-937"></span>     $01  Absolute time, 32 bit sized, using MPEG [MPEG] frames as unit
<span class="anchor" id="line-938"></span>     $02  Absolute time, 32 bit sized, using milliseconds as unit
<span class="anchor" id="line-939"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-940"></span>   Abolute time means that every stamp contains the time from the
<span class="anchor" id="line-941"></span>   beginning of the file.
<span class="anchor" id="line-942"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-943"></span>   The text that follows the frame header differs from that of the
<span class="anchor" id="line-944"></span>   unsynchronised lyrics/text transcription in one major way. Each
<span class="anchor" id="line-945"></span>   syllable (or whatever size of text is considered to be convenient by
<span class="anchor" id="line-946"></span>   the encoder) is a null terminated string followed by a time stamp
<span class="anchor" id="line-947"></span>   denoting where in the sound file it belongs. Each sync thus has the
<span class="anchor" id="line-948"></span>   following structure:
<span class="anchor" id="line-949"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-950"></span>     Terminated text to be synced (typically a syllable)
<span class="anchor" id="line-951"></span>     Sync identifier (terminator to above string)   $00 (00)
<span class="anchor" id="line-952"></span>     Time stamp                                     $xx (xx ...)
<span class="anchor" id="line-953"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-954"></span>   The 'time stamp' is set to zero or the whole sync is omitted if
<span class="anchor" id="line-955"></span>   located directly at the beginning of the sound. All time stamps should
<span class="anchor" id="line-956"></span>   be sorted in chronological order. The sync can be considered as a
<span class="anchor" id="line-957"></span>   validator of the subsequent string.
<span class="anchor" id="line-958"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-959"></span>   Newline characters are allowed in all "SLT" frames and should be used
<span class="anchor" id="line-960"></span>   after every entry (name, event etc.) in a frame with the content type
<span class="anchor" id="line-961"></span>   $03 - $04.
<span class="anchor" id="line-962"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-963"></span>   A few considerations regarding whitespace characters: Whitespace
<span class="anchor" id="line-964"></span>   separating words should mark the beginning of a new word, thus
<span class="anchor" id="line-965"></span>   occurring in front of the first syllable of a new word. This is also
<span class="anchor" id="line-966"></span>   valid for new line characters. A syllable followed by a comma should
<span class="anchor" id="line-967"></span>   not be broken apart with a sync (both the syllable and the comma
<span class="anchor" id="line-968"></span>   should be before the sync).
<span class="anchor" id="line-969"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-970"></span>   An example: The "ULT" passage
<span class="anchor" id="line-971"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-972"></span>     "Strangers in the night" $0A "Exchanging glances"
<span class="anchor" id="line-973"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-974"></span>   would be "SLT" encoded as:
<span class="anchor" id="line-975"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-976"></span>     "Strang" $00 xx xx "ers" $00 xx xx " in" $00 xx xx " the" $00 xx xx
<span class="anchor" id="line-977"></span>     " night" $00 xx xx 0A "Ex" $00 xx xx "chang" $00 xx xx "ing" $00 xx
<span class="anchor" id="line-978"></span>     xx "glan" $00 xx xx "ces" $00 xx xx
<span class="anchor" id="line-979"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-980"></span>   There may be more than one "SLT" frame in each tag, but only one with

<span class="anchor" id="line-989"></span>   Newline characters are allowed in the comment text string. There may

<span class="anchor" id="line-1001"></span>4.12.   Relative volume adjustment
<span class="anchor" id="line-1002"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1003"></span>   This is a more subjective function than the previous ones. It allows
<span class="anchor" id="line-1004"></span>   the user to say how much he wants to increase/decrease the volume on
<span class="anchor" id="line-1005"></span>   each channel while the file is played. The purpose is to be able to
<span class="anchor" id="line-1006"></span>   align all files to a reference volume, so that you don't have to
<span class="anchor" id="line-1007"></span>   change the volume constantly. This frame may also be used to balance
<span class="anchor" id="line-1008"></span>   adjust the audio. If the volume peak levels are known then this could
<span class="anchor" id="line-1009"></span>   be described with the 'Peak volume right' and 'Peak volume left'
<span class="anchor" id="line-1010"></span>   field. If Peakvolume is not known these fields could be left zeroed
<span class="anchor" id="line-1011"></span>   or completely omitted.  There may only be one "RVA" frame in each
<span class="anchor" id="line-1012"></span>   tag.

<span class="anchor" id="line-1022"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1023"></span>   In the increment/decrement field bit 0 is used to indicate the right
<span class="anchor" id="line-1024"></span>   channel and bit 1 is used to indicate the left channel. 1 is
<span class="anchor" id="line-1025"></span>   increment and 0 is decrement.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1026"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1027"></span>   The 'bits used for volume description' field is normally $10 (16 bits)
<span class="anchor" id="line-1028"></span>   for MPEG 2 layer I, II and III [MPEG] and MPEG 2.5. This value may not
<span class="anchor" id="line-1029"></span>   be $00. The volume is always represented with whole bytes, padded in
<span class="anchor" id="line-1030"></span>   the beginning (highest bits) when 'bits used for volume description'
<span class="anchor" id="line-1031"></span>   is not a multiple of eight.

<span class="anchor" id="line-1034"></span>4.13.   Equalisation
<span class="anchor" id="line-1035"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1036"></span>   This is another subjective, alignment frame. It allows the user to
<span class="anchor" id="line-1037"></span>   predefine an equalisation curve within the audio file. There may only
<span class="anchor" id="line-1038"></span>   be one "EQU" frame in each tag.

<span class="anchor" id="line-1042"></span>     Adjustment bits    $xx
<span class="anchor" id="line-1043"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1044"></span>   The 'adjustment bits' field defines the number of bits used for
<span class="anchor" id="line-1045"></span>   representation of the adjustment. This is normally $10 (16 bits) for
<span class="anchor" id="line-1046"></span>   MPEG 2 layer I, II and III [MPEG] and MPEG 2.5. This value may not be
<span class="anchor" id="line-1047"></span>   $00.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1048"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1049"></span>   This is followed by 2 bytes + ('adjustment bits' rounded up to the
<span class="anchor" id="line-1050"></span>   nearest byte) for every equalisation band in the following format,
<span class="anchor" id="line-1051"></span>   giving a frequency range of 0 - 32767Hz:
<span class="anchor" id="line-1052"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1053"></span>     Increment/decrement   %x (MSB of the Frequency)
<span class="anchor" id="line-1054"></span>     Frequency             (lower 15 bits)
<span class="anchor" id="line-1055"></span>     Adjustment            $xx (xx ...)
<span class="anchor" id="line-1056"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1057"></span>   The increment/decrement bit is 1 for increment and 0 for decrement.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1058"></span>   The equalisation bands should be ordered increasingly with reference
<span class="anchor" id="line-1059"></span>   to frequency. All frequencies don't have to be declared. Adjustments
<span class="anchor" id="line-1060"></span>   with the value $00 should be omitted. A frequency should only be
<span class="anchor" id="line-1061"></span>   described once in the frame.

<span class="anchor" id="line-1063"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1064"></span>4.14.   Reverb
<span class="anchor" id="line-1065"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1066"></span>   Yet another subjective one. You may here adjust echoes of different
<span class="anchor" id="line-1067"></span>   kinds. Reverb left/right is the delay between every bounce in ms.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1068"></span>   Reverb bounces left/right is the number of bounces that should be
<span class="anchor" id="line-1069"></span>   made. $FF equals an infinite number of bounces. Feedback is the amount
<span class="anchor" id="line-1070"></span>   of volume that should be returned to the next echo bounce. $00 is 0%,
<span class="anchor" id="line-1071"></span>   $FF is 100%. If this value were $7F, there would be 50% volume
<span class="anchor" id="line-1072"></span>   reduction on the first bounce, yet 50% on the second and so on. Left
<span class="anchor" id="line-1073"></span>   to left means the sound from the left bounce to be played in the left
<span class="anchor" id="line-1074"></span>   speaker, while left to right means sound from the left bounce to be
<span class="anchor" id="line-1075"></span>   played in the right speaker.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1076"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1077"></span>   'Premix left to right' is the amount of left sound to be mixed in the
<span class="anchor" id="line-1078"></span>   right before any reverb is applied, where $00 id 0% and $FF is 100%.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1079"></span>   'Premix right to left' does the same thing, but right to left. Setting
<span class="anchor" id="line-1080"></span>   both premix to $FF would result in a mono output (if the reverb is
<span class="anchor" id="line-1081"></span>   applied symmetric). There may only be one "REV" frame in each tag.

<span class="anchor" id="line-1098"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1099"></span>   This frame contains a picture directly related to the audio file.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1100"></span>   Image format is preferably "PNG" [PNG] or "JPG" [JFIF]. Description
<span class="anchor" id="line-1101"></span>   is a short description of the picture, represented as a terminated
<span class="anchor" id="line-1102"></span>   textstring. The description has a maximum length of 64 characters,
<span class="anchor" id="line-1103"></span>   but may be empty. There may be several pictures attached to one file,
<span class="anchor" id="line-1104"></span>   each in their individual "PIC" frame, but only one with the same
<span class="anchor" id="line-1105"></span>   content descriptor. There may only be one picture with the picture
<span class="anchor" id="line-1106"></span>   type declared as picture type $01 and $02 respectively. There is a
<span class="anchor" id="line-1107"></span>   possibility to put only a link to the image file by using the 'image
<span class="anchor" id="line-1108"></span>   format' "--&gt;" and having a complete URL [URL] instead of picture data.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1109"></span>   The use of linked files should however be used restrictively since
<span class="anchor" id="line-1110"></span>   there is the risk of separation of files.

<span class="anchor" id="line-1145"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1146"></span>   In this frame any type of file can be encapsulated. After the header,
<span class="anchor" id="line-1147"></span>   'Frame size' and 'Encoding' follows 'MIME type' [MIME] and 'Filename'
<span class="anchor" id="line-1148"></span>   for the encapsulated object, both represented as terminated strings
<span class="anchor" id="line-1149"></span>   encoded with ISO 8859-1 [ISO-8859-1]. The filename is case sensitive.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1150"></span>   Then follows a content description as terminated string, encoded as
<span class="anchor" id="line-1151"></span>   'Encoding'. The last thing in the frame is the actual object. The
<span class="anchor" id="line-1152"></span>   first two strings may be omitted, leaving only their terminations.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1153"></span>   MIME type is always an ISO-8859-1 text string. There may be more than
<span class="anchor" id="line-1154"></span>   one "GEO" frame in each tag, but only one with the same content
<span class="anchor" id="line-1155"></span>   descriptor.

<span class="anchor" id="line-1167"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1168"></span>   This is simply a counter of the number of times a file has been
<span class="anchor" id="line-1169"></span>   played. The value is increased by one every time the file begins to
<span class="anchor" id="line-1170"></span>   play. There may only be one "CNT" frame in each tag. When the counter
<span class="anchor" id="line-1171"></span>   reaches all one's, one byte is inserted in front of the counter thus
<span class="anchor" id="line-1172"></span>   making the counter eight bits bigger.  The counter must be at least
<span class="anchor" id="line-1173"></span>   32-bits long to begin with.

<span class="anchor" id="line-1181"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1182"></span>   The purpose of this frame is to specify how good an audio file is.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1183"></span>   Many interesting applications could be found to this frame such as a
<span class="anchor" id="line-1184"></span>   playlist that features better audiofiles more often than others or it
<span class="anchor" id="line-1185"></span>   could be used to profile a persons taste and find other 'good' files
<span class="anchor" id="line-1186"></span>   by comparing people's profiles. The frame is very simple. It contains
<span class="anchor" id="line-1187"></span>   the email address to the user, one rating byte and a four byte play
<span class="anchor" id="line-1188"></span>   counter, intended to be increased with one for every time the file is
<span class="anchor" id="line-1189"></span>   played. The email is a terminated string. The rating is 1-255 where
<span class="anchor" id="line-1190"></span>   1 is worst and 255 is best. 0 is unknown. If no personal counter is
<span class="anchor" id="line-1191"></span>   wanted it may be omitted.  When the counter reaches all one's, one
<span class="anchor" id="line-1192"></span>   byte is inserted in front of the counter thus making the counter
<span class="anchor" id="line-1193"></span>   eight bits bigger in the same away as the play counter ("CNT").
<span class="anchor" id="line-1194"></span>   There may be more than one "POP" frame in each tag, but only one with
<span class="anchor" id="line-1195"></span>   the same email address.

<span class="anchor" id="line-1205"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1206"></span>   Sometimes the server from which a audio file is streamed is aware of
<span class="anchor" id="line-1207"></span>   transmission or coding problems resulting in interruptions in the
<span class="anchor" id="line-1208"></span>   audio stream. In these cases, the size of the buffer can be
<span class="anchor" id="line-1209"></span>   recommended by the server using this frame. If the 'embedded info
<span class="anchor" id="line-1210"></span>   flag' is true (1) then this indicates that an ID3 tag with the
<span class="anchor" id="line-1211"></span>   maximum size described in 'Buffer size' may occur in the audiostream.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1212"></span>   In such case the tag should reside between two MPEG [MPEG] frames, if
<span class="anchor" id="line-1213"></span>   the audio is MPEG encoded. If the position of the next tag is known,
<span class="anchor" id="line-1214"></span>   'offset to next tag' may be used. The offset is calculated from the
<span class="anchor" id="line-1215"></span>   end of tag in which this frame resides to the first byte of the header
<span class="anchor" id="line-1216"></span>   in the next. This field may be omitted. Embedded tags is currently not
<span class="anchor" id="line-1217"></span>   recommended since this could render unpredictable behaviour from
<span class="anchor" id="line-1218"></span>   present software/hardware. The 'Buffer size' should be kept to a
<span class="anchor" id="line-1219"></span>   minimum. There may only be one "BUF" frame in each tag.

<span class="anchor" id="line-1234"></span>   a terminated string with a URL [URL] containing an email address, or a
<span class="anchor" id="line-1235"></span>   link to a location where an email adress can be found, that belongs to
<span class="anchor" id="line-1236"></span>   the organisation responsible for this specific encrypted meta frame.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1237"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1238"></span>   Questions regarding the encrypted frame should be sent to the
<span class="anchor" id="line-1239"></span>   indicated email address. If a $00 is found directly after the 'Frame
<span class="anchor" id="line-1240"></span>   size', the whole frame should be ignored, and preferably be removed.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1241"></span>   The 'Owner identifier' is then followed by a short content description
<span class="anchor" id="line-1242"></span>   and explanation as to why it's encrypted. After the
<span class="anchor" id="line-1243"></span>   'content/explanation' description, the actual encrypted block follows.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1244"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1245"></span>   When an ID3v2 decoder encounters a "CRM" frame, it should send the
<span class="anchor" id="line-1246"></span>   datablock to the 'plugin' with the corresponding 'owner identifier'
<span class="anchor" id="line-1247"></span>   and expect to receive either a datablock with one or several ID3v2
<span class="anchor" id="line-1248"></span>   frames after each other or an error. There may be more than one "CRM"
<span class="anchor" id="line-1249"></span>   frames in a tag, but only one with the same 'owner identifier'.

<span class="anchor" id="line-1258"></span>4.21.   Audio encryption
<span class="anchor" id="line-1259"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1260"></span>   This frame indicates if the actual audio stream is encrypted, and by
<span class="anchor" id="line-1261"></span>   whom. Since standardisation of such encrypion scheme is beyond this
<span class="anchor" id="line-1262"></span>   document, all "CRA" frames begin with a terminated string with a
<span class="anchor" id="line-1263"></span>   URL containing an email address, or a link to a location where an
<span class="anchor" id="line-1264"></span>   email address can be found, that belongs to the organisation
<span class="anchor" id="line-1265"></span>   responsible for this specific encrypted audio file. Questions
<span class="anchor" id="line-1266"></span>   regarding the encrypted audio should be sent to the email address
<span class="anchor" id="line-1267"></span>   specified. If a $00 is found directly after the 'Frame size' and the
<span class="anchor" id="line-1268"></span>   audiofile indeed is encrypted, the whole file may be considered
<span class="anchor" id="line-1269"></span>   useless.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1270"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1271"></span>   After the 'Owner identifier', a pointer to an unencrypted part of the
<span class="anchor" id="line-1272"></span>   audio can be specified. The 'Preview start' and 'Preview length' is
<span class="anchor" id="line-1273"></span>   described in frames. If no part is unencrypted, these fields should be
<span class="anchor" id="line-1274"></span>   left zeroed. After the 'preview length' field follows optionally a
<span class="anchor" id="line-1275"></span>   datablock required for decryption of the audio. There may be more than
<span class="anchor" id="line-1276"></span>   one "CRA" frames in a tag, but only one with the same 'Owner
<span class="anchor" id="line-1277"></span>   identifier'.

<span class="anchor" id="line-1288"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1289"></span>   To keep space waste as low as possible this frame may be used to link
<span class="anchor" id="line-1290"></span>   information from another ID3v2 tag that might reside in another audio
<span class="anchor" id="line-1291"></span>   file or alone in a binary file. It is recommended that this method is
<span class="anchor" id="line-1292"></span>   only used when the files are stored on a CD-ROM or other circumstances
<span class="anchor" id="line-1293"></span>   when the risk of file seperation is low. The frame contains a frame
<span class="anchor" id="line-1294"></span>   identifier, which is the frame that should be linked into this tag, a
<span class="anchor" id="line-1295"></span>   URL [URL] field, where a reference to the file where the frame is
<span class="anchor" id="line-1296"></span>   given, and additional ID data, if needed. Data should be retrieved
<span class="anchor" id="line-1297"></span>   from the first tag found in the file to which this link points. There
<span class="anchor" id="line-1298"></span>   may be more than one "LNK" frame in a tag, but only one with the same
<span class="anchor" id="line-1299"></span>   contents. A linked frame is to be considered as part of the tag and
<span class="anchor" id="line-1300"></span>   has the same restrictions as if it was a physical part of the tag
<span class="anchor" id="line-1301"></span>   (i.e. only one "REV" frame allowed, whether it's linked or not).
<span class="anchor" id="line-1302"></span>

<span class="anchor" id="line-1308"></span>   
<span class="anchor" id="line-1309"></span>   Frames that may be linked and need no additional data are "IPL",
<span class="anchor" id="line-1310"></span>   "MCI", "ETC", "LLT", "STC", "RVA", "EQU", "REV", "BUF", the text
<span class="anchor" id="line-1311"></span>   information frames and the URL link frames.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1312"></span>   
<span class="anchor" id="line-1313"></span>   The "TXX", "PIC", "GEO", "CRM" and "CRA" frames may be linked with the
<span class="anchor" id="line-1314"></span>   content descriptor as additional ID data.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1315"></span>   
<span class="anchor" id="line-1316"></span>   The "COM", "SLT" and "ULT" frames may be linked with three bytes of
<span class="anchor" id="line-1317"></span>   language descriptor directly followed by a content descriptor as
<span class="anchor" id="line-1318"></span>   additional ID data.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1319"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1320"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1321"></span>5.   The 'unsynchronisation scheme'
<span class="anchor" id="line-1322"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1323"></span>   The only purpose of the 'unsychronisation scheme' is to make the ID3v2
<span class="anchor" id="line-1324"></span>   tag as compatible as possible with existing software. There is no use
<span class="anchor" id="line-1325"></span>   in 'unsynchronising' tags if the file is only to be processed by new
<span class="anchor" id="line-1326"></span>   software. Unsynchronisation may only be made with MPEG 2 layer I, II
<span class="anchor" id="line-1327"></span>   and III and MPEG 2.5 files.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1328"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1329"></span>   Whenever a false synchronisation is found within the tag, one zeroed
<span class="anchor" id="line-1330"></span>   byte is inserted after the first false synchronisation byte. The
<span class="anchor" id="line-1331"></span>   format of a correct sync that should be altered by ID3 encoders is as
<span class="anchor" id="line-1332"></span>   follows:
<span class="anchor" id="line-1333"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1334"></span>         %11111111 111xxxxx
<span class="anchor" id="line-1335"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1336"></span>   And should be replaced with:
<span class="anchor" id="line-1337"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1338"></span>         %11111111 00000000 111xxxxx
<span class="anchor" id="line-1339"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1340"></span>   This has the side effect that all $FF 00 combinations have to be
<span class="anchor" id="line-1341"></span>   altered, so they won't be affected by the decoding process. Therefore
<span class="anchor" id="line-1342"></span>   all the $FF 00 combinations have to be replaced with the $FF 00 00
<span class="anchor" id="line-1343"></span>   combination during the unsynchonisation.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1344"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1345"></span>   To indicate usage of the unsynchronisation, the first bit in 'ID3
<span class="anchor" id="line-1346"></span>   flags' should be set. This bit should only be set if the tag
<span class="anchor" id="line-1347"></span>   contained a, now corrected, false synchronisation. The bit should
<span class="anchor" id="line-1348"></span>   only be clear if the tag does not contain any false synchronisations.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1349"></span>   
<span class="anchor" id="line-1350"></span>   Do bear in mind, that if a compression scheme is used by the encoder,
<span class="anchor" id="line-1351"></span>   the unsyncronisation scheme should be applied *afterwards*. When
<span class="anchor" id="line-1352"></span>   decoding a compressed, 'unsyncronised' file, the 'unsyncronisation
<span class="anchor" id="line-1353"></span>   scheme' should be parsed first, compression afterwards.

<span class="anchor" id="line-1445"></span>   reasons.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1446"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1447"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1448"></span>A.1.   Overview
<span class="anchor" id="line-1449"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1450"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1451"></span>   The ID3-Tag is an information field for MPEG Layer 3 audio files.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1452"></span>   Since a standalone MP3 doesn't provide a method of storing other
<span class="anchor" id="line-1453"></span>   information than those directly needed for replay reasons, the
<span class="anchor" id="line-1454"></span>   ID3-tag was invented by Eric Kemp in 1996.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1455"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1456"></span>   A revision from ID3v1 to ID3v1.1 was made by Michael Mutschler to
<span class="anchor" id="line-1457"></span>   support track number information is described in A.4.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1458"></span>

<span class="anchor" id="line-1461"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1462"></span>   The Information is stored in the last 128 bytes of an MP3. The Tag
<span class="anchor" id="line-1463"></span>   has got the following fields, and the offsets given here, are from
<span class="anchor" id="line-1464"></span>   0-127.

<span class="anchor" id="line-1475"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1476"></span>   The string-fields contain ASCII-data, coded in ISO-Latin 1 codepage.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1477"></span>   Strings which are smaller than the field length are padded with zero-
<span class="anchor" id="line-1478"></span>   bytes.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1479"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1480"></span>     Tag: The tag is valid if this field contains the string "TAG". This
<span class="anchor" id="line-1481"></span>        has to be uppercase!
<span class="anchor" id="line-1482"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1483"></span>     Songname: This field contains the title of the MP3 (string as
<span class="anchor" id="line-1484"></span>        above).
<span class="anchor" id="line-1485"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1486"></span>     Artist: This field contains the artist of the MP3 (string as above).
<span class="anchor" id="line-1487"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1488"></span>     Album: this field contains the album where the MP3 comes from
<span class="anchor" id="line-1489"></span>        (string as above).
<span class="anchor" id="line-1490"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1491"></span>     Year: this field contains the year when this song has originally

<span class="anchor" id="line-1638"></span>A.4.   Track addition - ID3v1.1
<span class="anchor" id="line-1639"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1640"></span>   In ID3v1.1, Michael Mutschler revised the specification of the
<span class="anchor" id="line-1641"></span>   comment field in order to implement the track number. The new format
<span class="anchor" id="line-1642"></span>   of the comment field is a 28 character string followed by a mandatory
<span class="anchor" id="line-1643"></span>   null ($00) character and the original album tracknumber stored as an
<span class="anchor" id="line-1644"></span>   unsigned byte-size integer. In such cases where the 29th byte is not
<span class="anchor" id="line-1645"></span>   the null character or when the 30th is a null character, the
<span class="anchor" id="line-1646"></span>   tracknumber is to be considered undefined.
